# A Remote Auditory Diagnosis System as a Method of Telemedicine for Hearing Rehabilitation

**Lay Abstract**  
Driven by the initiative to adopt social distancing under the spread of COVID-19, health care facilities tend to offer more clinical services through telehealth appointments, which allows patients to avoid in-person contacts and queuing while accessing health care from home. The hearing test is a typical methodology to diagnose hearing loss. During pre-COVID times, patients are guided by an audiologist to hear sounds produced by a machine to investigate their minimum noticeable volume. This research project aims to design a hearing test system that allows unsupervised testing through a personal device remotely. This system should produce pure tones of different intensities and frequencies, and according to the participants’ responses, compute plots displaying their hearing thresholds. The testing results can present a preliminary report for doctors or be used by patients to simply monitor their hearing regularly. From the perspective of the Canadian health delivery system, this application can increase health care efficiency by eliminating patients’ travel time as well as reducing wait time in clinics; it also eases the workload of audiologists by offering an alternative for in-person examinations. It is additionally beneficial to the public health especially during the time of pandemic.
